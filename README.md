## Project: K-means for Image compression

### Project Overview

In this this project, I implemented the K-means algorithm and used it for image compression. we will first start on an example 2D dataset that will help gain an intuition of how the K-means algorithm works. After that, we wil use the K-means algorithm for image compression by reducing the number of colors that occur in an image to only those that are most common in that image.
